GETOK is a Fast Python Script to Automate The Alive Subdomains Probering 

Just run it and you will know how to use it 

# You will see in Verbose
The Count of the Alive subs
The Estimated time to finish probing
The Alive Sub with it's http status code
The Dead Sub with "Failed Time out"


Once the tool is done it creates a file named "result.txt" and saves the output in it
Simple and modular code making it easy to contribute.
